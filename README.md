# Fraction Adder
Program for the mathematical addition of simple fractions.

## Further user information
- The code is one of my first projects, so variables and comments were still written in German.
- The language used does not influence input or output.
- The programme only calculates the addition product of two simple fractions.

### Application
- The function "add-frac" is used for the calculation. (Without exclamation marks).
- The function input of the two fractions is used as follows: add-frac( counter 1, nominator 1, counter 2, nominator 2 )
